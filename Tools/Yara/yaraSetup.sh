# CCDC Development - Automated Yara Installer & Rule Sanitizer
#
# Description: Installs Yara, clones the Neo23x0/signature-base ruleset,
#              removes files that cause errors in standard Yara, and compiles
#              the remaining rules into a single production file.
# Author:      Samuel Brucker
# Version:     1.1 (Corrected)
